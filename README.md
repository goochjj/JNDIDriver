Basic JDBC java.sql.Driver class that handles connecting to a JNDI named object.  (Which should be a javax.sql.DataSource)

See https://github.com/lucee/JDBC-extension-factory, specifically the build/JNDIDriver folder, for the Lucee module.

If you use ant to compile this, it builds the jar for that project.  (Or you can just use it as a JDBC driver)
